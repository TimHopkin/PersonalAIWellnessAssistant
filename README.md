## API Costs & Limits

### Grok API
- **Model**: grok-beta (~$0.30-$0.50/million tokens)
- **Usage**: ~1000-5000 tokens per plan generation
- **Estimated Cost**: $0.001-$0.005 per plan

### Google Calendar API
- **Free tier**: 1 billion requests/month
- **Cost**: Free for personal use

### Device APIs
- **Garmin**: Free for approved developers
- **Renpho**: Unofficial API (no official costs)

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

- `GROK_API_KEY`: Your Grok API key (required)
- `GARMIN_CLIENT_ID`: Garmin OAuth client ID (optional)
- `GARMIN_CLIENT_SECRET`: Garmin OAuth secret (optional)
- `RENPHO_EMAIL`: Renpho account email (optional)
- `RENPHO_PASSWORD`: Renpho account password (optional)

### Profile Customization
The profile supports:
- Demographics (age, weight, height)
- Fitness level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- Activity preferences (running, yoga, meditation, etc.)
- Time constraints and availability
- Personal goals and constraints

## Device Integration

### Current Status
- **Garmin**: Stub implementation with manual fallback
- **Renpho**: Stub implementation with manual fallback

### Future Enhancement
Both integrations are stubbed for the MVP but include the framework for:
- OAuth authentication flows
- API endpoint integration
- Automatic data syncing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"GROK_API_KEY not found"**
- Ensure you've created `.env` file with your API key
- Check that your Grok subscription is active

**"Calendar authentication failed"**
- Verify `credentials.json` is in the project directory
- Ensure Google Calendar API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Delete `token.pickle` and re-authenticate if needed

**"No activities planned for today"**
- Generate a wellness plan first
- Ensure the plan start date includes today
- Check that activities were successfully scheduled

**"Error generating plan"**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Grok API key is valid and has quota
- Try using the fallback plan generator

### Reset Everything
To start fresh, delete these files:
```bash
rm profile.json wellness_plan.json progress_data.json token.pickle scheduling_results.json
```

## Development Notes

### Code Structure
- **Modular design**: Each component (profile, planning, calendar, tracking) is separate
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures
- **Data persistence**: JSON files for local storage
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new features and integrations

### Extending the MVP
1. **Web Interface**: Replace CLI with Flask/FastAPI web app
2. **Database**: Replace JSON files with PostgreSQL/SQLite
3. **Advanced AI**: Use Grok-2 for more sophisticated planning
4. **Real Device Integration**: Implement full OAuth flows
5. **Team Features**: Multi-user support and social features

## Security Notes

- Store API keys in `.env` file (never commit to version control)
- Google OAuth tokens are stored locally in `token.pickle`
- Profile data stays on your local machine
- Device credentials are optional and only for your personal use

## License

Personal use only. This MVP is designed for individual wellness management.
